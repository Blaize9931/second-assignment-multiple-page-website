                <p>We’re a slightly over-caffeinated, big-hearted fire service that runs toward danger while everyone else runs away (usually carrying hoses, axes, and questionable snacks). Founded on bravery, teamwork, and a shared love of sirens, we specialize in putting out fires, rescuing cats who absolutely did not want rescuing, and making heroic entrances at 3 a.m. Our crew is highly trained, mildly sarcastic, and fully committed to keeping people safe—whether that means battling blazes, saving the day, or explaining for the hundredth time why burning toast does *not* require a full emergency response.
