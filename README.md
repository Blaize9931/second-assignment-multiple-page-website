# second-assignment-multiple-page-website
***
This is my second attempt at a website. However! This time there is 4 pages. This week we have been taught to use Flexbox, and its properties to allow for it to be responsive. Within this page, I have used pseudo elements. On top of that, I have incorporated CSS variables to simplify making colour changes.
