                <p>Hold the hose! Despite the flashing lights, heroic language, and confident tone, this website is entirely false. No fires will be fought, no rescues will be performed, and absolutely no emergency response will occur as a result of anything you see here. This site exists purely for creative, educational, or entertainment purposes—and possibly because I thought it would be funny to make, due to my name being Blaize.</p>
